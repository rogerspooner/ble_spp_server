Based on Espressif ble_spp_server_demo
Use a mobile phone with a Bluetooth app e.g. "Bluetooth for Arduino"
This can send text strings in a terminal or set attributes like writing to registers (with richer types).

This program seems to like GATT properties from Bluetooth For Arduino. Not so much the serial terminal of Dabble.
Also likes Blue, which sets attributes.

There are many layers and protocols within Bluetooth.

This program doesn't talk of pairing, which I expected.
